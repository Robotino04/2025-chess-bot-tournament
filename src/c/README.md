# Getting started (C language version)

## Setup
- Ensure you have a working C compiler installed (e.g. gcc)
- Copy all of the `.c`, `.h` files into a directory
- Modify `example_bot.c` with your own code
- Compile and run!
  - Tip: Easiest to test by adding as a bot to a compatible chess program

Be sure to refer to the docs to see how to use the API!
