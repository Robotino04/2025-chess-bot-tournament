# Getting started (Haskell)

To get started, just download [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/) and build the bot using `stack build`.

API docs are available [here](https://chayleaf.github.io/shiro-chessapi-hs/Chess.html).

The Haskell bindings are maintained [externally](https://github.com/chayleaf/shiro-chessapi-hs), please report any issues to @chayleaf.

The only file you're allowed to modify is `src/Main.hs`. However, if you want to update the bindings themselves, you are allowed to update `stack.yaml` to bump the commit hash.
