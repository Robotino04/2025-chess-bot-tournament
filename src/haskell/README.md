# Getting started (Haskell language version)

## Setup
- The Haskell bindings are volunteer-maintained and can be found [here]().

Be sure to refer to the [docs](https://github.com/shiro-nya/2025-chess-bot-tournament/wiki/Chess-API-(Haskell)) to see how to use the API!

## Specifics
- For the purpose of this challenge, the "stdlib" is considered to be `base`, `containers` and `array`.
